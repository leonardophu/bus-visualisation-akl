# Introduction
The files contained here provide all the necessary code (given a full day's worth of data, the static GTFS, and the protobuf file) to generate animations. The three important folders are **dataAnimation**, **dataInterpolation**, and **dataCleaning**. The folder **previousDataCleaning** contains previous attempts at data cleaning/extraction.

**Note:** Each folder includes an R file with the term *initialisation* in its name. These R files contain information that the user must fill out, such as directories where data will be stored, dictionaries where specific data are kept, and the date the data was collected.

# Running
Given that all the directories and files are stored, and the initialised files are updated to the user liking. Can run runPB.pb file to automate everything
